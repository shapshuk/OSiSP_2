Although the U.S. | Open was being held in Las Vegas, the other people at the Mariposa Hotel seemed oblivious to it.
In the main room the players at the craps tables, at roulette and at the blackjack tables wore brightly colored double-knits and shirts; | they went about their business in silence. | On the other side of the casino was the hotel coffee shop. | The day before the tournament Beth walked down an aisle between crapshooters where the main sound was the tapping of clay chips and of dice on felt.
In the coffee shop she slid onto a stool at the counter, turned around to look at the mostly empty booths and saw a handsome young man sitting hunched over a cup of coffee, alone. | It was Townes, from Lexington. | She stood up and went over to the booth. "Hello," she said.
He looked up and blinked, not recognizing her at first. | Then he said,"Harmon! For Christ's sake!" | "Can I sit down?" | "Sure," he said. | "I should have known you. You were on the list."
"The list?" | "The tournament list. I'm not playing. Chess Review sent me to write it up." | He looked at her. "I could write you up. For the Herald-Leader."
"Lexington?"
"You got it. You've grown a lot, Harmon. I saw the piece in Life." | | He looked at her closely. | "You've even gotten good-looking."
